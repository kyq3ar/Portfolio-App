      I joined Capital One immediately after graduating from Rochester Institute of Technology. My peers know me as a full stack designer / unicorn, and Iâ€™m familiar with all aspects of the design process, but my strongest skillset lies in visual prototyping. I am a craftsman at heart, and I strive for strong execution. However, it is the process that informs my decisions.
